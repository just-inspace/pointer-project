# pointer-project
## Proving understanding of pointers

My name is Justin Westra and this will be my first project on Github

I'm using the github platform as a tool to understand version control in preparation for working as a programmer

## Some background:
I studied computer science in college and worked for about 2 years in the field
After some personal setbacks I sought out a change in field and have dabbled in a myriad of career paths since then

In those 4 years, I've come to appreciate my love of technology as an integral part of who I am

So I've decided to return to computer science and get myself up to speed on what has changed

## Project Goals
The goal of this first project is as follows:

Become comfortable with Github's GUI
Download and work with Git at the command line
Release a simple C project demonstrating pointers
Release this project as a base for my dev portfolio
  
# Project Outline
## The purpose of this program:
#### Fundamentally understand Pointers
#### Clarify the difference between:
```
pointer
the 'address of' operator
the 'dereference' operator
the difference between pointer, *pointer, and &pointer
allocating and freeing memory
what a void pointer is
```
